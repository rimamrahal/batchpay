Batch Payment for Incentivized Experiments

## Description
This R code can be used for batch bank transfers (SEPA payments). It inputs an .xlsx file and produces an .xml file in the ISO 20022 standard, which can then be fed into your banking software / banking app. 

## Newbie Coder
Hooray, this is the first time I'm committing code to GitHub. That also means it might not work the way I wanted it to yet, just as a fair warning.
